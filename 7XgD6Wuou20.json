            "text": "Wokeism seems to me a dangerous problem, and I think I see what he means by Luciferianism (a mentality of \"do as thou wilt\") but AP rightly points out that Islam is no less \"depraved\" in its morality, its justification of violence and its authoritarianism. Seems to me that AP feels that Islam is more dangerous because he is more familiar with its oppression and Jordan is hyperfocused on wokeism because he comes from a scholarly background where he was targeted by it. Both are underappreciating the dangerousness of the other ideology in my opinion. These ideologies feel like they are poised to clash violently in the near future",

Muslims are punished and eventually killed, for thinking and questioning their belief through these apostasy laws by not conforming to the doctrines, traditions and practices of this cult. A fearmongering tactic ensuring muslims stay ignorant about their belief.  Notice how all muslims appeal to scholars and never try and use their brain. All muslim scholars unashamedly lie through their teeth in every and all situations. How can anyone stay in this cult? Is beyond me.\nSura 4:167-8\nSura 4:137\nSura 3:87",
